# Batch-Binary-Kummer-BBK251
#Implementor: Sabyasachi Karati

The base implementation is the the software BBE251 which is available at
the following site:

https://binary.cr.yp.to/edwards.html

We only modify the fieldelement.h, core2.cpp and gates.cpp files of the 
downloaded code to make it work for binary Kummer line BKL251. 

The followings are the descriptions of the available directories:

1. BBK251_FB: contains the batch sofware of fixed-base scalar multiplications
of binary Kummer line BKL251.

2. BBK251_VB: contains the batch sofware of variable-base scalar multiplications
of binary Kummer line BKL251.
